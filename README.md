# strong-update
The 'Strong' app is a workout tracker app gym logger. It produces different graphs from this log, charting elements of your workouts. 

I have used this app for the last two years, and while I enjoy the primary objective of logging my workouts, the graphs can be lacking with the information I personally need.

I called this the strong-update because in part, this is an updated feature of the 'Strong' app. Using the data exported from the app, I have created the graphs I need to visualise my workout performance, and more importantly, I can view this over a specific period of time.

The graphs I have included show my workout duration, my top 10 exercises, and the number of different workouts I have completed.
